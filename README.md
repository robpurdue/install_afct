# Azure Function Core Tools Installer
This will allow a user to quickly (and repeatedly) install Azure Function Core Tools (AFCT).

After cloning the repo, do the following:
1. `cd acft`
2. `chmod +x install_acft.sh`
3. `./install_acft.sh`
4. `source ~/.profile`

You can then confirm that AFCT is running by entering `func --version`
